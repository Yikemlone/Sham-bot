# Styling
We wanna try and keep the styling of code consistent.

Try and follow these:

1. Camelcase for methods and variables
2. Uppercase for classes 
3. constants upper case

Let me know if you think we should add anything else here.

## How I think we should design

I think if we all want to add our own functions, we should make classes for them, then import them into the main "index.js", so it makes it so we all aren't stepping on each others toes. 


We can work on the same file if we are doing similar things, just let each other know what you are gonna do.
